# Virtual-Staining-Algorithm

To summarize your outlined process based on the notes:

1. **Preprocessing Pipeline**: You have done steps such as resizing, grayscale conversion, contrast enhancement, sharpening, thresholding, background removal, morphological operations, and histogram equalization.
   
2. **File Generation**:
   - **First File**: Save the dataset for direct use in deep learning, likely formatted with inputs (original RGB images) and labels (red and green channels) required for U-Net training.
   - **Second File**: Includes labeled images, which undergo thresholding, morphological operations, and edge detection to prepare labeled segmentation maps.

3. **U-Net Model**:
   - **Architecture**: Utilize a U-Net with RGB as inputs and two output channels (representing the "virtual" red and green stains).
   - **Training Details**: Use AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of \(10^{-4}\), weight decay of \(10^{-5}\), and mean squared error (MSE) loss.
   - **Epochs**: Train the model for 1000 epochs with batch size adjustments as per the requirement.

4. **Quality Estimation**:
   - Perform a segmentation accuracy evaluation with fixed-threshold segmentation scenarios. Using metrics like TROC curves, assess how well the virtual staining images reproduce physical staining results, calculating the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for viability and accuracy of cell segmentation.

Does this capture all the main points for your planned implementation? Let me know if you'd like assistance with any specific part, such as code snippets for U-Net training or processing steps.

Got it! Hereâ€™s a refined breakdown for your two output files:

1. **First File (Preprocessed Images)**:
   - This file will contain only the **preprocessed images**. These are images that have undergone resizing, grayscale conversion, contrast enhancement, sharpening, and histogram equalization, but **without any additional segmentation or label data**. This set can be used as the input data for deep learning training.

2. **Second File (Labeled Segmentation Maps)**:
   - This file will include the **preprocessed images** along with **labeled segmentation maps** for the red and green channels.
   - Each labeled image will have the following structure:
     - **Original Preprocessed Image**: This serves as a base image.
     - **Red and Green Channels**: These are the virtual stain channels (representing live and dead cells).
     - **Processing on Red and Green Channels**: The red and green channels undergo thresholding, morphological operations, and edge detection to create segmentation maps.
   - These processed red and green channels will be combined with the original preprocessed image and saved together as **labeled images**.

This setup will allow you to have a consistent dataset where:
- The **First File** provides inputs for your U-Net model.
- The **Second File** gives labeled segmentation maps, aligning with the ground truth that the model will learn to predict.
